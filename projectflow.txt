Steps to create the following project :

1. Write code on setup.py and pyproject.toml file to import local packages
2. Create a virtual environment, activate it, and install the required dependencies from 
   requirements.txt
   conda create -n housing python=3.10 -y
   conda activate housing
   add required modules to requirements.txt
   Do "pip install -r requirements.txt"
   Note : Install Anaconda if not already installed
   conda env remove -n proj1 (If want to remove existing project)
   add required modules to requirements.txt
   Do "pip install -r requirements.txt"
3. Do a "pip list" on terminal to make sure you have local packages installed.
